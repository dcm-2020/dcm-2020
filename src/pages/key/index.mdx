      Title: Bioinformatics analysis application “Socrates” can get over discordance between clinical expert and bioinformatician
    </p>

      Abstract: As comprehensive analysis has become the mainstream of genomic research, publicly available genomic data has been increasing. Publicly available genomic data is powerful tool for many researchers. However, we had to learn programming language and bioinformatics skill to handle with comprehensive genomic data. Learning these skills is difficult for usual biological researcher, especially for medical researcher, which causes dissociation between researchers and bioinformatician. To solve this problem, we created a new application named “Socrates”. Socrates is fully made-to-order software. Using Socrates, researcher can handle with genomic and clinical information without learning programing skill. Socrates can make medical researchers analyze publicly available data like TCGA, CCLE, GEO, Array Express, dbGap. To date, studies using publicly available genomic data had weakness that researchers had to give up if there was no data that suits their purpose. To overcome this weakness, we are challenging to create new prediction methods using publicly data by machine learning. We call this system “virtual laboratory system”. The purpose of establishing “virtual laboratory system” is to predict future experimental results in computer system without wet laboratory work. Combining with “Socrates” and “virtual laboratory system” could make many researchers dramatic cost and time savings without effort to learn difficult programing skill. Although we are now challenging to establish this system, we will present achievements so far in this conference.
